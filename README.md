Tableau visualization of Cardiovascular Disease - Kaggle Dataset

Summary:
This tableau visvulization shows comprehensive analysis of a cardiovascular disease dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset comprises 70 rows and 11 features, offering valuable insights into the factors associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The analysis provides insights into the dataset's characteristics, potential correlations, and implications for healthcare professionals, public health officials, researchers, and dieticians.

Data:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset

Key Insights:
* 		Balanced Dataset: The dataset is balanced, allowing for unbiased analysis and meaningful conclusions.
* 		Gender Distribution: The dataset consists of 60% females and 40% males, indicating a fair representation of both genders.
* 		Age Range: Both males and females in the dataset fall within the age range of 53-63, suggesting a similar age distribution among patients.
* 		Alcohol and Smoking: While there is no clear evidence of a direct impact of alcohol intake and smoking on CVD, the imbalanced input of these factors may have influenced the results. Further investigation may be required to establish any relationships.
* 		Female Vulnerability: Females with an overall blood pressure of 160/90 are more vulnerable to CVD, highlighting the importance of blood pressure management in women.
* 		Height and Weight: Women with approximately 165cm height and 72kg weight are at risk of CVD, emphasizing the significance of maintaining a healthy weight.
* 		Physical Activity: Surprisingly, the dataset suggests that physical activity does not have a significant impact on CVD. However, this finding may warrant further exploration and validation.
* 		Glucose and Cholesterol: Most patients in the dataset have normal glucose and cholesterol levels, making it challenging to determine their role in CVD. Nevertheless, research has indicated the importance of cholesterol in CVD.

Conclusion:
This analysis of the Kaggle cardiovascular disease dataset provides valuable insights into various aspects of CVD. While it offers some preliminary findings regarding factors such as gender, blood pressure, and weight, further research and analysis are needed to establish concrete relationships. Healthcare professionals, public health officials, researchers, and dieticians can benefit from this analysis, but they should consider potential biases and complexities in healthcare data analysis when interpreting the results. Effective communication of these findings to relevant stakeholders is crucial for informed decision-making in healthcare.

Key Considerations:
* 		Bias: Be mindful of potential biases, such as sampling bias, measurement bias, and reporting bias, when drawing conclusions from healthcare datasets.
* 		Interpretation: Healthcare data analysis is complex; consider other factors and features that may influence the results and be cautious in making causal claims.
* 		Communication: Clearly and effectively communicate the findings to healthcare professionals and stakeholders to ensure informed decision-making and further research in the field of cardiovascular disease.
